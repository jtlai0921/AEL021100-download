Rain, sea, surf, sand, clouds and sky
Hush, now darling don't you cry
There's a mocking bird singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird singing songs just for you and me
Rain, sea, surf, sand, clouds and sky
Time will see your tears run dry
There's a mocking bird singing songs in the trees
There's a mocking bird singing songs just for you and me
Rain, sea, surf, sand clouds and sun
Bless the tears of love now gone
